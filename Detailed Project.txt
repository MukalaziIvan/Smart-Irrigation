Introduction:

Welcome to the world of Precision AgriTech's cutting-edge Smart Irrigation System, designed and developed by netLabs!lJG. Our client, a forward-thinking farm, is dedicated to sustainable agriculture and seeks to revolutionize their farming practices with this advanced system. The primary goal of this project is to optimize water usage, increase crop yield, and reduce operational costs.

To achieve these ambitious objectives, our team is tasked with creating a sophisticated system that integrates various components. The heart of the system is the ESP32 microcontroller board, which will serve as the central hub for data processing and control. It will be responsible for receiving data from soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity sensors, providing vital information for the irrigation process.

One of the key components driving the system's intelligence is the implementation of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms will analyze the data collected by the sensors and provide valuable insights into the optimal irrigation schedule, considering factors such as soil moisture levels and ambient light intensity.

The project also includes the development of a web application that will offer real-time visualizations of the system's performance. With this application, farmers will have an intuitive and convenient way to monitor the irrigation process, view sensor data, and analyze trends, enabling informed decision-making to enhance agricultural productivity.

To facilitate remote control and management, Bluetooth connectivity will be integrated into the system. This feature will empower farmers to adjust irrigation settings and monitor their crops even from a distance, offering flexibility and convenience in the farming process.

Lastly, actuators will be incorporated into the system to facilitate automatic and precise irrigation. By coupling the ML algorithms' recommendations with the actuators, the system can respond dynamically to the changing needs of the crops, ensuring optimal water delivery for growth and health.

With this comprehensive and innovative Smart Irrigation System, Precision AgriTech aims to achieve sustainable agricultural practices, increase crop yields, and reduce water wastage. Through the dedicated efforts of netLabs!lJG, we are excited to contribute to the realization of these goals, revolutionizing farming practices for a better and more efficient agricultural future.


Part 1: Embedded System Design

To begin the design of the Smart Irrigation System, we will focus on creating the microcontroller circuit that will serve as the brain of the system. The key components we'll be using are the ESP32 Development Board, Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor Module, Submersible Digital Temperature Sensor, LDR Light Dependent Resistor GL5506, 20x4 Display LCD Module, and a Water Pump.

1. ESP32 Development Board:
The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller board with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. It will be the central controller of our Smart Irrigation System, responsible for gathering data from various sensors, processing that data, running the ML algorithms, and controlling the actuators.

2. Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor Module:
The resistive soil moisture sensor module will be used to measure the moisture content in the soil. By measuring the soil's moisture level, the system can determine when and how much water to deliver to the crops, optimizing irrigation.

3. Submersible Digital Temperature Sensor:
The submersible digital temperature sensor will provide accurate temperature readings of the soil. Soil temperature plays a crucial role in crop growth, and by monitoring it, the system can make more informed decisions about irrigation timing and water quantity.

4. LDR Light Dependent Resistor GL5506:
The LDR sensor will detect the ambient light intensity. This information is valuable for the system to adjust irrigation schedules based on the available natural light, providing efficient use of resources.

5. 20x4 Display LCD Module:
The 20x4 LCD display module will be used to show real-time data and system status. It will enable farmers to monitor sensor readings, ML algorithm outputs, and any relevant information directly from the microcontroller board.

6. Water Pump:
The water pump is the actuator responsible for delivering water to the crops based on the system's decisions. The ESP32 will control the water pump to ensure precise and efficient irrigation.

Circuit Overview:
The components will be interconnected in the circuit as follows:

1. The ESP32 Development Board will serve as the main controller and connect to all other components.
2. The Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor Module and Submersible Digital Temperature Sensor will be connected to analog input pins of the ESP32 to measure soil moisture and temperature, respectively.
3. The LDR sensor will be connected to another analog input pin to measure light intensity.
4. The 20x4 Display LCD Module will be connected to digital pins to display real-time data.
5. The Water Pump will be connected to a digital output pin of the ESP32 to control its operation.

Microcontroller Firmware:
The microcontroller's firmware will be responsible for the following tasks:

1. Reading data from the soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity sensors.
2. Implementing the ML algorithms to analyze the sensor data and determine the optimal irrigation schedule.
3. Displaying real-time data and system status on the 20x4 LCD Display Module.
4. Controlling the Water Pump based on the ML algorithm's decisions for precise irrigation.

By integrating these key components into the microcontroller circuit and firmware, we'll have the foundation of our Smart Irrigation System, ready to optimize water usage, increase crop yield, and reduce operational costs for Precision AgriTech's farm.


To configure the ESP32 microcontroller board for collecting sensor readings and controlling the water pump, we need to establish the connections between the board and the sensors/actuator. Additionally, we'll write a simple Arduino code to read data from the sensors and display it on the 20x4 Display LCD Module. We'll also control the water pump based on the sensor readings.

6. Water Pump:
   - Connect one terminal of the water pump to a digital output pin (e.g., D2) on the ESP32.
   - Connect the other terminal of the water pump to a 5V pin on the ESP32.

Step 2: Arduino Code
Now, let's write a simple Arduino code to read data from the sensors and display it on the LCD. We'll also control the water pump based on the sensor readings. Please note that this is just a basic example to get you started, and you may need to adapt it according to your specific sensors and requirements.

```arduino
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

// Define the I2C address of the LCD module
#define LCD_ADDRESS 0x27
#define LCD_COLS 20
#define LCD_ROWS 4

// Define pin numbers for the sensors and water pump
#define MOISTURE_SENSOR_PIN A0
#define TEMP_SENSOR_PIN D1
#define LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN A1
#define WATER_PUMP_PIN D2

// Initialize the LCD object with I2C address and dimensions
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(LCD_ADDRESS, LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);

void setup() {
  // Start the LCD
  lcd.begin(LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);
  lcd.backlight();

  // Initialize Serial communication for debugging (optional)
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // Read sensor values
  int moisture = analogRead(MOISTURE_SENSOR_PIN);
  int temperature = digitalRead(TEMP_SENSOR_PIN);
  int light = analogRead(LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN);

  // Display sensor values on the LCD
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Moisture: ");
  lcd.print(moisture);

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print("Temperature: ");
  lcd.print(temperature);

  lcd.setCursor(0, 2);
  lcd.print("Light: ");
  lcd.print(light);

  // Control the water pump based on moisture level (example)
  if (moisture < 500) {
    // If moisture is low, turn on the water pump
    digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, HIGH);
  } else {
    // If moisture is sufficient, turn off the water pump
    digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, LOW);
  }

  // Add a delay for stability (adjust as needed)
  delay(1000);
}
```

Step 3: Uploading the Code
1. Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed for the I2C LCD module and ESP32 board support.
2. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
3. Open the Arduino IDE, select the appropriate board and port under the "Tools" menu.
4. Copy the above code into a new Arduino sketch.
5. Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to your ESP32 board.

After successfully uploading the code, the ESP32 will start reading data from the sensors and display it on the 20x4 LCD Module. Additionally, it will control the water pump based on the moisture level (you can adjust the threshold in the code).

Please note that this is a basic example, and depending on the specific sensors and actuators you are using, you may need to calibrate the sensors, adjust the code, and implement more advanced features as required for your Smart Irrigation System.



To implement Cloud Data Logging and Autonomous Irrigation using Firebase and the ESP32, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up Firebase Realtime Database
1. Create a Firebase account and log in to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new Firebase project and follow the instructions to set it up.
3. In the Firebase Console, navigate to the "Realtime Database" section.
4. Click on "Create Database" and choose the location for your database.
5. Select "Start in test mode" for now (you can adjust the security rules later based on your requirements).
6. Your Firebase Realtime Database is now set up, and you will see a URL for your database (something like https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com/).

Step 2: Install Required Libraries
1. Install the Firebase ESP32 library using the Arduino Library Manager. To do this, open the Arduino IDE, go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries," and search for "Firebase ESP32." Install the library.
2. Install the necessary libraries for the sensors and actuators you are using.

Step 3: Update Arduino Code
Now, we'll update the Arduino code to include Firebase communication and autonomous irrigation control based on the ML model's predictions. In this example, I'll assume you already have the ML model integrated into the code, and it provides irrigation predictions.

```arduino
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
#include <FirebaseESP32.h>
#include <WiFi.h>

// Define the I2C address of the LCD module
#define LCD_ADDRESS 0x27
#define LCD_COLS 20
#define LCD_ROWS 4

// Define pin numbers for the sensors and actuators
#define MOISTURE_SENSOR_PIN A0
#define TEMP_SENSOR_PIN D1
#define LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN A1
#define WATER_PUMP_PIN D2

// Firebase Configuration
#define FIREBASE_HOST "your-project-id.firebaseio.com"  // Replace with your Firebase project URL
#define FIREBASE_AUTH ""  // Leave this blank if you don't have Firebase Authentication enabled

// Initialize the LCD object with I2C address and dimensions
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(LCD_ADDRESS, LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);

// Create an instance of the Firebase Data object
FirebaseData fbdo;

void setup() {
  // Start the LCD
  lcd.begin(LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);
  lcd.backlight();

  // Initialize Serial communication for debugging (optional)
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin("your-ssid", "your-password");  // Replace with your Wi-Fi credentials
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print(".");
  }
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");

  // Initialize Firebase
  Firebase.begin(FIREBASE_HOST, FIREBASE_AUTH);
}

void loop() {
  // Read sensor values
  int moisture = analogRead(MOISTURE_SENSOR_PIN);
  int temperature = digitalRead(TEMP_SENSOR_PIN);
  int light = analogRead(LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN);

  // Display sensor values on the LCD
  lcd.setCursor(0, 0);
  lcd.print("Moisture: ");
  lcd.print(moisture);

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print("Temperature: ");
  lcd.print(temperature);

  lcd.setCursor(0, 2);
  lcd.print("Light: ");
  lcd.print(light);

  // Assume you have the ML model integrated and it provides irrigation predictions
  // Replace the following line with your actual logic for irrigation predictions
  bool shouldIrrigate = getIrrigationPrediction(moisture, temperature, light);

  // Control the water pump based on the irrigation predictions
  if (shouldIrrigate) {
    digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, HIGH); // Turn on the water pump
    // Log the irrigation event to Firebase
    Firebase.pushInt(fbdo, "/irrigation_events", moisture);
  } else {
    digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, LOW); // Turn off the water pump
  }

  // Add a delay for stability (adjust as needed)
  delay(1000);
}
```

In this code, we have added the Firebase initialization and data logging functionality. The `getIrrigationPrediction()` function is assumed to be your custom function that processes sensor data and provides the ML model's irrigation predictions.

Please ensure that you replace `"your-project-id"` and `"your-ssid"` with your actual Firebase project ID and Wi-Fi SSID, respectively. If you have enabled Firebase Authentication, make sure to include your Firebase Authentication token in the `FIREBASE_AUTH` constant.

With this code, the ESP32 will collect sensor data, make irrigation predictions using the ML model, control the water pump autonomously, and log the irrigation events to Firebase in real-time. You can access the logged data from the Firebase Console and use it for further analysis and decision-making.


To enable remote control capabilities for the Smart Irrigation System using Bluetooth communication on the ESP32, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Install the Required Libraries
1. Install the ESP32 Arduino Core from the Arduino Library Manager if you haven't already.
2. Install the "BluetoothSerial" library from the Arduino Library Manager. This library provides the necessary functions for Bluetooth communication on the ESP32.

Step 2: Update Arduino Code
Now, let's update the Arduino code to include Bluetooth communication for remote control.

```arduino
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
#include <BluetoothSerial.h>

// Define the I2C address of the LCD module
#define LCD_ADDRESS 0x27
#define LCD_COLS 20
#define LCD_ROWS 4

// Define pin numbers for the sensors and actuators
#define MOISTURE_SENSOR_PIN A0
#define TEMP_SENSOR_PIN D1
#define LIGHT_SENSOR_PIN A1
#define WATER_PUMP_PIN D2

// Firebase Configuration and other code here...

// Initialize the LCD object with I2C address and dimensions
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(LCD_ADDRESS, LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);

// Create an instance of the BluetoothSerial class
BluetoothSerial SerialBT;

void setup() {
  // Start the LCD
  lcd.begin(LCD_COLS, LCD_ROWS);
  lcd.backlight();

  // Initialize Serial communication for debugging (optional)
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Connect to Wi-Fi and Firebase initialization here...

  // Initialize Bluetooth
  SerialBT.begin("SmartIrrigationSystem"); // Set the Bluetooth name that will be visible to other devices

  // Other setup code here...
}

void loop() {
  // Read sensor values and irrigation predictions here...

  // Control the water pump based on the irrigation predictions here...

  // Handle Bluetooth commands
  if (SerialBT.available()) {
    String command = SerialBT.readStringUntil('\n');
    command.trim();

    // Process received commands
    if (command == "pump_on") {
      digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, HIGH); // Turn on the water pump
      SerialBT.println("Pump turned ON");
    } else if (command == "pump_off") {
      digitalWrite(WATER_PUMP_PIN, LOW); // Turn off the water pump
      SerialBT.println("Pump turned OFF");
    } else {
      SerialBT.println("Invalid command");
    }
  }

  // Add a delay for stability (adjust as needed)
  delay(1000);
}
```

In this updated code, we have added the necessary Bluetooth initialization and handling. The ESP32 will start advertising itself as a Bluetooth device with the name "SmartIrrigationSystem" that can be discovered and connected to by other Bluetooth-enabled devices.

When a Bluetooth connection is established, the ESP32 will listen for commands sent from the remote device. In this example, we handle two commands: "pump_on" and "pump_off." When the ESP32 receives either of these commands, it will turn the water pump on or off accordingly and send a response back to the remote device.

Please note that this example demonstrates a simple remote control functionality using Bluetooth. Depending on your specific requirements, you can expand the commands and implement more sophisticated control mechanisms over Bluetooth.

To control the irrigation schedule and settings remotely, you can define additional commands and modify the code accordingly. For instance, you could send commands to adjust the irrigation interval, set the ML algorithm parameters, or activate a manual irrigation mode.

With this implementation, authorized users can connect to the Smart Irrigation System using Bluetooth-enabled devices and remotely control its operation, making the irrigation process even more flexible and convenient.
